# Data Science - Coursera Specialization

Here are some of my solutions from Coursera specialization [Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) by Johns Hopkins University in 2015:

 * Exploratory Data Analysis,
 * Reproducible Research,
 * Statistical Inference,
 * Regression Models,
 * Practical Machine Learning,
 * Developing Data Products.

The external Shinny app for *Developing Data Products* course is available on [ShinyApps](https://andre.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/) and the Slidify presentation is available on [Github Pages](https://andre-wojtowicz.github.io/jhu-data-science/presentation).
